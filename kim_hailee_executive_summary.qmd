## Introduction 

This analysis examines Airbnb listing prices across Paris, New York, and Sydney, focusing on distribution patterns and the influence of property characteristics on pricing. This dataset was sourced from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground), accessed on November 3rd, 2024. 

## Data Overview

The dataset comprises 279,712 listings with 33 variables, including categorical, logical, and numeric data. Some variables such as district (`district`), estimate of how long the Host takes to respond (`host_response_time`), and rating data (`review_scores_rating`, `review_scores_accuracy`...) exhibit significant missing values, necessitating careful handling during analysis. The amenities variable (`amenities`), the only untidy variable in the dataset, was transformed into separate binary columns to indicate the presence or absence of each amenity.

## Univariate Analysis

![Paris has the highest number of listings at 64,690, followed by New York with 37,012, and Sydney with 33,630](plots/price.png){#fig-price}

Among the 10 cities represented, Paris, New York, and Sydney account for 48% of listings, with 64,690, 37,012, and 33,630 listings respectively as shown in @fig-price. Price distributions in these cities are right-skewed, where Paris shows a more compact distribution, suggesting standardized pricing, while New York and Sydney exhibit broader distributions, reflecting diverse markets with a wider range of prices.

## Bivariate Analysis


```{r}
#| label: tbl-1
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics for Price within Each City"
#| echo: false 

top_3_cities |>
  group_by(city) |>
  summarize(
    mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_price = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_price = min(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_price = max(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) |> arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Summary statistics in @tbl-1 reveal that Sydney has the highest average price (mean: 222.01) and the largest variability (standard deviation: 472.63), indicating a diverse pricing landscape. Paris has a lower mean price (113.10) and smaller variability (standard deviation: 214.43), suggesting a more homogeneous pricing structure. New York's mean price (142.84) and variability (standard deviation: 275.74) position it between Paris and Sydney.

## Multivariate Analysis

![Heatmap of correlations between price and selected variables (accommodates, bedrooms, minimum nights, latitude, longitude) across Sydney, Paris, and New York](plots/heatmap.png){#fig-heatmap}

As shown in @fig-heatmap, Correlations between price and property features indicate that the number of accommodations and bedrooms are positively correlated with price across all three cities, with Sydney showing the strongest correlations. Minimum nights show negligible correlation with price, suggesting limited impact on pricing decisions. Geographical variables (latitude and longitude) exhibit weak correlations with price, indicating that location influences are more neighborhood-specific rather than based on broad geographical trends.

## Conclusion

Property size, as indicated by the number of accommodations and bedrooms, is a significant predictor of price in all three cities, especially in Sydney. Minimum stay requirements and broad geographical location have minimal impact on pricing, suggesting that other factors, such as neighborhood desirability and specific amenities, play more substantial roles. Next steps include:

* **Amenity Analysis**: Investigate the correlation between specific amenities and listing prices to identify features that add the most value.
* **Regression Modeling**: Develop models to understand the combined effect of multiple variables on pricing.
* **Categorical Variables**: Explore the impact of property type and host status (e.g., superhost) on pricing dynamics.
