## Introduction

I selected the **Airbnb listings dataset** inspired by my recent Thanksgiving trip to Joshua Tree National Park, where I used Airbnb for accommodations. My recent travels across North America and Canada using Airbnb have not only familiarized me with its system but also piqued my interest in the underlying dynamics of the service. This analysis aims to explore key patterns and relationships in Airbnb listing data, guided by research questions such as:

-   What attributes influence the pricing of Airbnb listings in major cities?
-   How do pricing patterns vary across different cities, and what insights can we draw from these differences?
-   How do factors like the number of bedrooms, accommodations, and minimum nights impact prices?

The dataset was sourced from **Maven Analytics**, a reputable provider of data training and datasets. The datasets were freely available on a resource page titled "Data Playground."[^1] This dataset includes all the necessary information for conducting exploratory data analysis, eliminating the need for merging additional datasets.

## Data Overview & quality

The dataset comprises **279,712 observations** across **33 variables**, including 1 date variable, 9 categorical variables (originally character, converted to factors), 4 logical variables, and 19 numeric variables. Certain variables, such as 'district', 'host_response_time', 'host_response_rate', 'host_acceptance_rate', and review data, exhibit low completeness with a significant proportion of missing values, necessitating careful consideration during analysis.

The dataset is generally tidy, **except for the amenities attribute**, which contains a list of amenities (e.g., \["Heating", "Kitchen", "Washer", "Wifi", "Long term stays allowed"\]). To address this, I transformed each amenity into a separate binary column to indicate its presence (1) or absence (0) in each listing.

For analysis, prices were compared within the same city to maintain consistency and avoid complications arising from **variations in local currencies**. This approach enables meaningful bivariate and multivariate analyses, focusing on relationships between price and variables such as 'accommodates', 'bedrooms', and 'minimum_nights'.

## Univariate Analysis

![Paris has the highest number of listings at 64,690, followed by New York with 37,012, and Sydney with 33,630](plots/price.png){#fig-price}

As shown in @fig-price, the univariate analysis of the city variable shows that there are **10 distinct cities** listed in the dataset. **Paris, New York, and Sydney** emerged as the top three cities with the highest number of listings, collectively representing a significant portion of the total data. Given the overall dataset encompasses **279,712 listings**, with these three cities alone accounting for **135,332 listings**, which is **48%** of the total, a strategic decision was made to focus my analysis on these locations.

### Paris

![Log-transformed price distribution in Paris, with the majority of values centered around the 10-100 range](plots/price-dist-paris.png){#fig-paris}

### New York

![Log-transformed price distribution in New York, showcasing a broader spread with a peak near 100](plots/price-dist-new-york.png){#fig-ny}

### Sydney

![Log-transformed price distribution in Sydney, indicating a moderate spread with prices concentrated near 100](plots/price-dist-sydney.png){#fig-sydney}

@fig-paris, @fig-ny, and @fig-sydney show the right-skewed log-transformed price distributions for selected cities: Paris, New York, and Sydney. @fig-paris indicates that in Paris, the distribution is approximately symmetric, with a clear peak around the center, suggesting that most prices are concentrated within a relatively narrow range. New York’s distribution, while also centered, shows a broader spread and a slightly flatter peak, indicating a wider variety of prices and a more diverse market as shown in @fig-ny. In contrast, in @fig-sydney, Sydney’s distribution resembles New York’s in its broader shape but has a slightly lower peak, reflecting a moderate concentration of prices and an even distribution across the range. These shapes highlight the unique pricing dynamics in each city, with Paris displaying a more centralized pattern, while New York and Sydney show greater variability.

## Bivariate Analysis

```{r}
#| label: tbl-1
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics for Price within Each City"
#| echo: false 

top_3_cities |>
  group_by(city) |>
  summarize(
    mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_price = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_price = min(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_price = max(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) |> arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

@tbl-1 summarizes mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum prices for Airbnb listings across top 3 cities. Sydney has the highest average price (mean: 222.01) and the largest variability, with a standard deviation of 472.63, indicating a highly diverse pricing landscape. This variability is reflected in the large range between the minimum price (5) and maximum price (28,613), suggesting the presence of both affordable and luxury pricing segments. Paris, in contrast, has a much lower mean price of 113.10 and a smaller standard deviation of 214.43. The relatively small spread suggests a more homogenous pricing structure, where prices are concentrated closer to the median of 80. New York falls in between, with a mean price of 142.84 and a standard deviation of 275.74. Its median price of 99 is slightly higher than Paris, but the broader spread indicates a market with a moderate level of diversity.

@fig-boxplot visually highlights these differences in pricing trends across the three cities. New York exhibits a compact distribution, with the majority of prices tightly grouped near the median, which aligns with the lower standard deviation observed in the summary statistics. This suggests that New York's pricing market may be more stable and predictable. Paris shows a wider distribution, with prices more evenly spread across the range. This reflects the city’s dynamic market, likely influenced by factors such as varying property types and economic diversity. Sydney, on the other hand, displays the broadest distribution, with prices extending across a significantly wider range. The relatively low density around the median price of 120, combined with the wide spread, indicates that Sydney may have more extreme pricing categories, including high-end luxury markets.

## Multivariate Analysis

To further explore the factors influencing price across New York, Paris, and Sydney, we examine the correlations between price and selected variables: number of accommodations, number of bedrooms, minimum nights, latitude, and longitude. @tbl-2 provides the numerical correlations, while @fig-heatmap visualizes these relationships.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-2
#| tbl-cap: "Correlations Between Price and Selected Variables by Top 3 Cities"
#| echo: false 

top_3_cities |>
  group_by(city) |>
  summarise(
    cor_accommodates = cor(accommodates, price, use = "complete.obs"),
    cor_bedrooms = cor(bedrooms, price, use = "complete.obs"),
    cor_minimum_nights = cor(minimum_nights, price, use = "complete.obs"),
    cor_latitude = cor(latitude, price, use = "complete.obs"),
    cor_longtitude = cor(longitude, price, use = "complete.obs")
  ) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

As shown in @tbl-2, the number of people a property accommodates and the number of bedrooms are positively correlated with price across all three. cities. Sydney exhibits the strongest correlation for both variables, with accommodates at 0.37 and bedrooms at 0.39. This suggests that larger properties command higher prices, particularly in Sydney, where market trends might favor spacious accommodations. New York and Paris show similar, albeit slightly weaker, correlations (accomodates at ~0.27 and bedrooms at ~0.25 and 0.20, respectively). This indicates that while size impacts price, the effect is less pronounced than in Sydney.

The correlation between minimum nights and price is negligible in all cities, with values close to zero. This suggests that the minimum stay requirement has little to no impact on pricing decisions, likely because it’s influenced more by policy or local regulations than market-driven factors. 

Moreover, geographical location exhibits weak correlations with price in all cities. In Sydney, latitude shows a slight positive correlation (0.13), potentially reflecting higher prices in northern or southern areas, while longitude has a near-zero correlation (0.12). In contrast, both latitude and longitude show slight negative correlations in Paris and New York. The negative correlations in these cities suggest that pricing patterns might not align strongly with broad geographical gradients but are instead influenced by finer, neighborhood-specific factors. As such, I decided not to investigate further correlations between location and price through spatial visualization, such as mapping. 

![Visual representation of the correlation strength between price and selected variables (accommodates, bedrooms, minimum nights, latitude, longitude) across cities](plots/heatmap.png){#fig-heatmap}

The heatmap in @fig-heatmap highlights the strong correlations between accommodates and bedrooms with price, particularly in Sydney, where property size plays a more critical role in pricing compared to New York and Paris. The consistently light shades for minimum_nights confirm its negligible influence on price across all cities, likely driven by policy rather than market dynamics. Geographical variables (latitude and longitude) show weak correlations overall, with slightly darker tones in Sydney indicating a marginally greater influence of location compared to Paris and New York. This visualization reinforces that property size is the primary driver of price, while location and minimum nights have minimal impact.


## Conclusion

1.  Bivariate analysis

-   Are there outliers or significant differences in price ranges across cities?

2.  Multivariate analysis

-   How do various features such as the number of guests accommodated, number of bedrooms, and minimum nights correlate with listing prices?
-   Which features have the strongest relationship with price, and does this relationship vary by city?
